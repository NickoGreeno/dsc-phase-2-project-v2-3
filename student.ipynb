    "# Overview\n",
    "This project analyzes the oppurtunity for Zillow, an online real estate marketplace company, to encourage homeowners in making smart renovations to increase their home's equity. Exploratory data analysis shows trends in home value are related to certain home features and can be touched on to make one's residence more noteworthy. Models can be made using this data to implement a tool Zillow can use to make impactful suggestions."

    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "Zillow, as previously stated, is an online real estate marketplace company. Online and founded by former Microsoft executives, is a company familiar with implementing user friendly data-driven tools.\n",

    "### What We Are Answering\n",
    "We are seeking to provide competitive insight as to which renovations provide value within a home by building a statistical regression model. It will answer how certain renovations tied to certain aspects of a home generate a calulable surplus in home value."

    "### Data Summary\n",
    "The data comes from the metropolitan King County, Washington, a northwestern part of the country. King County holds a population of 2,269,675 according to the 2020 census, making it more populous than the average county. King County is strongly liberal, has a large minority demographic of at least 35.2 perecent, and its 2016 median household income is above its contemporary US average counterpart 57,617, at 78,800. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming these characteristics still hold true, it could suggest that prices for renovations may yield more here than other parts of the country since King County seems pricier than the average county. That detail can be overlooked when generalizing our model however, so no cause for concern. The fact that the area is quite diverse helps the model as well, since it helps the model project for all kinds of people using it. Lastly, the population of the area serves to improve the model because the amount of people is sufficient to draw accurate conclusions from."

The majority of renovations have been made within the last 30 years which makes sense because some houses built up to that point needed updating. The mean is lower than the median which suggests that the earliest renovations skew the data left."
