    "# Overview\n",
    "This project analyzes the oppurtunity for Zillow, an online real estate marketplace company, to encourage homeowners in making smart renovations to increase their home's equity. Exploratory data analysis shows trends in home value are related to certain home features and can be touched on to make one's residence more noteworthy. Models can be made using this data to implement a tool Zillow can use to make impactful suggestions."

    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "Zillow, as previously stated, is an online real estate marketplace company. Online and founded by former Microsoft executives, is a company familiar with implementing user friendly data-driven tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Are Answering\n",
    "We are seeking to provide competitive insight as to which renovations provide value within a home by building a statistical regression model. It will answer how certain renovations tied to certain aspects of a home generate a calulable surplus in home value."

    "### Data Summary\n",
    "The data comes from the metropolitan King County, Washington, a northwestern part of the country. King County holds a population of 2,269,675 according to the 2020 census, making it more populous than the average county. King County is strongly liberal, has a large minority demographic of at least 35.2 perecent, and its 2016 median household income is above its contemporary US average counterpart 57,617, at 78,800. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming these characteristics still hold true, it could suggest that prices for renovations may yield more here than other parts of the country since King County seems pricier than the average county. That detail can be overlooked when generalizing our model however, so no cause for concern. The fact that the area is quite diverse helps the model as well, since it helps the model project for all kinds of people using it. Lastly, the population of the area serves to improve the model because the amount of people is sufficient to draw accurate conclusions from."

    "Looking at variables that a homeowner could change, there appears to be potential in improving home value when observing the condition of the house. Related to maintenence of a house, the condition refers to levels of pleasentness that the house can be. For instance, if a house were in poor condition, then it would automatically be worth .0075 logs less than the average house. As the condition improves however, the price increases. Take a house in the best condition, very good, due to its condition it is worth .0320 logs more than the average house. That total swing in price is .0395 logs, or in plain language, a 4% increase in value. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Enacting this change would mean to to address the components giving the house a poor grade. By standards from the King County, that includes the house being worn out, needing repair and overhaul on painted surfaces, and needing fixed in areas of roofing, plumbing, and heating.\n",
    "* A house in very good condition on the other hand, has items well maintained, with many overhauled and repaired if they have shown signs of wear. It is practically new in most ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A shift in the houses condition from fair to just good would net a change of .0341 logs in price, or about 3.5%\n",
    "\n",
    "*  To do this, fix the problems giving the house a fair grading. That is the house being badly worn, having many items needing refinishing or overhauling, with deferred maintenance obvious, and inadequate building utility and systems all shortening the life expectancy, increasing the effective age.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A house in good conditition has practically nothing immediately wrong with it, and will last longer than the typical house.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it may seem obvious, the model was helpful in determining how much of a change that going from a poor or fair kept house to a good or very good kept house would make. The changes also address the bones of the household, so it may be more subjective to each house, but the overall advice in this case is to update the foundations of a home."

If a house were in the 50th percentile, bigger than 50% of houses, then expanded to be bigger than 52% of houses, it would become 30% more valuable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The model found that size has an influential role in determining home value. While making large scale additions to the house would be costly in itself, it seems that it would pay off when it comes time to sell the house. Better yet, make the addition to the house a new bedroom or expand on rooms of the house that are already its strong points.  "

A person could simply enter the parameters of their home and find out areas of improvement, such as if they are willing to update their home's features to improve its condition. The system, since it works with percentages, would take in their appraised home value then apply theoretical renovations that the homeowner chooses, the model would then provide a predictive home value. \n",
